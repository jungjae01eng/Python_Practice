# Python_Practice
These Codes are from Python Tutorial by TechWorld with Nana on the Youtube channel. I used this to learn and practice Python.
Each project covered diverse skills and was able to explore different types of problems.


## Tutorial.py
Explored basic Python, such as Functions, Input, Built-In Functions, and Modules, with some notes/comments.
Even though I had prior knowledge of Java, C, and other programming languages, this was the first step in learning Python.


## Project01_Countdown_App.py
It is the most basic code where I find the current time and the set time to calculate how much time I have.


## Project02_Automation.py
Learned how to read and edit Excel using Python. It was a huge step as I believe this is an essential and great skill to have.
I plan to retry this and make other codes that involve Excel and Python later.


## Project03_Classes_and_Objects.py
Used Classes and Objects to organize the code. It is crucial as it allows group functions and variables, which helps keep all of the data together in one place.
